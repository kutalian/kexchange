What This Platform Is & How It Works

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Kutalian Exchange is a digital commodities trading platform where participants operate virtual businesses, produce tradeable goods, and earn real USD profits through strategic market participation.
Core Concept: A persistent economic simulation where all value is created by participants, all prices are determined by market forces, and all profits are earned through skill-based decisions—not luck or gambling.

### 1. WHAT IS KUTALIAN EXCHANGE?
In Simple Terms:
Kutalian Exchange is a real-money commodities marketplace where:

Participants invest real USD to start virtual businesses
Businesses produce commodities (oil, steel, wheat, etc.)
All commodities are traded on a central exchange with transparent pricing
Participants buy and sell to earn profits
Profits can be withdrawn as real USD

It operates like a combination of:

Real commodity exchanges (CME, ICE, LME) — transparent order books, real-time pricing
Business simulation — participants own and operate production companies
Player-driven economy — no computer-generated goods, all supply comes from participants
